Built a serverless data quality watchdog for real-time financial APIs using Vercel, Great Expectations, MongoDB, and SendGrid. It automates hourly ingestion, change detection via hashing, validation of OHLCV data, historical storage, email alerting on failures, and Grafana dashboards for observabilityâ€”all cost-free and production-ready with tests and CI.
